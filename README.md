### 📱 About
This project was built using several advanced CSS concepts, and with this project I have learned a lot of new properties and tools, for example, properties like ```clip-path``` 
to build this complex design, [cubic-bezier](https://cubic-bezier.com/#.17,.67,.83,.67) to create advanced animations, BEM and 7 - 1 patterns to create a better architecture
in projects, and not less important, I learned SASS to pre-process CSS!
